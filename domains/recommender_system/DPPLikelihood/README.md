## Abstract
| Component | Definition | Example |
|-|-|-|
| Problem Definition | Existing sequential recommendation techniques lack tailored loss functions that fit naturally into the practical application scenario of sequential recommender systems. | Such as `cross-entropy` and `Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)` are widely used in the sequential recommendation area, but suffer from 2 inherent drawbacks: <br> 1.  the dependencies among elements of a sequence are overlooked in these loss formulations;  <br> 2.  Instead of balancing accuracy (quality) and diversity, only generating accurate results has been over emphasized.   |
| Proposed Solution | Two new loss functions based on the `Determinantal Point Process (DPP) likelihood`, which captures natural dependencies among temporal actions, and a `quality` vs. `diversity` decomposition of the DPP kernel to push beyond accuracy-oriented loss functions. | `DPP Set Likelihood-Based Loss`, `Conditional DPP Set Likelihood-Based Loss` |
| Experiment Result | The proposed loss functions show marked improvements over state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods in both quality and diversity metrics in experiments on three real-world datasets. | - |
