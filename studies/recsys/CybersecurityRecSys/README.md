## Abstract
This paper discusses the valuable role recommender systems may play in cybersecurity. First, a comprehensive presentation of recommender system types is presented, as well as their advantages and disadvantages, possible applications and security concerns. Then, the paper collects and presents the state of the art concerning the use of recommender systems in cybersecurity; both the existing solutions and future ideas are presented. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: to date, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no work collecting the applications of recommenders for cybersecurity. Moreover, this paper attempts to complete a comprehensive survey of recommender types, after noticing that other works usually mention twoâ€“three types at once and neglect the others.
