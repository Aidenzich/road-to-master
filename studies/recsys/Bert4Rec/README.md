BERT4Rec is a deep learning-based recommendation model that utilizes the Transformer architecture of the `BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)` language model. BERT4Rec is specifically designed for recommendation tasks, such as `next item recommendation`, by incorporating the `user's historical behavior` and `item information` into its input representation. This allows the model to effectively capture the relationship between items and users, and generate more accurate recommendations. The BERT4Rec model has shown promising results in several benchmark datasets and has been widely adopted in various recommendation systems.
