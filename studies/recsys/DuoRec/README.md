## Abstract
- According to our study, **the distribution of item embeddings generated by these models(SASRec, BERT4Rec. etc) tends to degenerate into an [anisotropic](https://www.google.com/search?q=anisotropic&rlz=1C5CHFA_enTW974TW974&oq=anisotropic&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l5j69i60l2.2546j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) shape**, which may result in `high semantic similarities` among embeddings. 
- In this paper, both empirical and theoretical investigations of this representation degeneration problem are first provided, based on which a novel recommender model DuoRec is proposed to improve the item embeddings distribution.
- Specifically, in light of the uniformity property of contrastive learning, a contrastive regularization is designed for DuoRec to **reshape the distribution of sequence representations**. 
- Given the convention (假設或按一般慣例) that the recommendation task is performed by measuring the similarity between `sequence representations` and `item embeddings` in the same space via `dot product`, the `regularization` can **be implicitly applied to the item embedding distribution**. 
    - Existing contrastive learning methods mainly rely on `data level augmentation` for useritem interaction sequences through item `cropping`, `masking`, or `reordering` and can **hardly** provide `semantically consistent(語義一致)` augmentation samples. 
    - In DuoRec:
        - a model-level augmentation is proposed based on Dropout to enable better semantic preserving. 
        - a novel sampling strategy is developed, **where sequences having the `same target item`** are chosen `hard positive samples`.
        - Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DuoRec model compared with baseline methods. 
- Visualization results of the learned representations validate that DuoRec can largely `alleviate(減輕)` the representation degeneration problem.
